        <p class="lead"> Newton proposed that planetary orbits are mostly elliptical because of the Sun’s
            gravitation. The Principia contains the law of universal gravitation and the three Newtonian laws of
            motion. The law of universal gravitation states that every particle of matter in the universe attracts
            every other particle with a force that is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely
            proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. The first Newtonian law of motion is
            the principle of inertia, stating a body continues in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a
            straight line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed upon it. The second law
            states that the change of motion of an object is proportional to the force impressed and is made in the
            direction of the straight line in which the force is impressed. The third law states that to every
            action there is an equal and opposite reaction. These principles are the groundwork for all modern
            understanding of movement and physics.</p>

                <li><strong>1668:</strong>
                    Newton invented the reflecting telescope. </li>
                <li><strong>1672: </strong>He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society(FRS).</li>
                <li><strong>1687:</strong>He published three laws of motion, i.e, <b><i>Law of Inertia, Law of
                            Force and Acceleration and law of action and reaction.</b></i>
                <li><strong>1703:</strong>
                    Newton was elected president of the Royal Society.</li>
                <li><strong>1704:</strong> He published the first edition of Opticks, a work summarizing his
                    research in light and colors.</li>
                <li><strong>1727:</strong> Newton died in London, England, and was buried at Westminster Abbey.
