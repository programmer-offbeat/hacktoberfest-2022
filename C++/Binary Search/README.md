- Binary search is the most popular Search algorithm.

- It is efficient and also one of the most commonly used techniques that is used to solve problems.

- If all the names in the world are written down together in order and you want to search for the position of a specific name, binary search will accomplish this in a **maximum** of iterations.

- Binary search works only on a `sorted` set of elements. 

- To use binary search on a collection, the **collection must first be sorted**.
