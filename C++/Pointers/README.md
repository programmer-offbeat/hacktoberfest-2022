# What are Pointers?

- A pointer is a variable whose value is the **address** of another variable.

# Uses

- Pointers allow you to refer to the **same space** in memory from multiple locations. 

- This means that, you can update memory in one location and the change can be seen from another location in your program. 

- You will also save space by being able to share components in your data structures.
